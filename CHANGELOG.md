# Changelog

All notable changes to Stix will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-08

A full editor for longer notes, recoverable deletion, and
more reliable saves across Stix's windows. This update also adds Simplified
Chinese, makes privacy choices explicit, and reduces repeated work in search.

### Before upgrading

- **Requires macOS 14 Sonoma or later.** The application and bundled DarwinKit sidecar now declare the same minimum version.
- Back up your notes and, if you use locked notes, export your recovery key from **Settings → Privacy** and keep it somewhere secure. The legacy key file is removed only after its replacement has been written to Keychain and read back successfully. Do not manually delete it if migration reports an error.
- Existing notes keep their filenames. **Simple filenames** is an opt-in setting for new notes; without a date in the filename, streaks and On This Day use the file's modification date.
- Re-import previously configured custom fonts that do not render. Imported fonts are now copied into Stix's font directory, so moving or deleting the original download does not break them.
- Remote images in Markdown are blocked by default. Enable **Load remote images automatically** only if you want notes to contact external image hosts. Analytics also requires explicit opt-in.

### Added

- **Full editor:** browse, search, and edit notes in a dedicated window, with consistent handling of nested folders.
- **Recoverable Trash:** restore deleted notes without overwriting an existing file of the same name. Permanent deletion is a separate action.
- **Vault Health:** check storage access, writability, and differences between files and the search index; rebuild the index and export diagnostics when investigating a problem.
- **Simplified Chinese:** switch between English, 简体中文, and the system language in Settings. Theme names, editor hints, and other translated UI text follow language changes.
- **Optional readable filenames:** save new notes as `meeting-notes.md`; duplicate names receive a suffix instead of replacing another note. The existing timestamped naming scheme remains the default. ([#91](https://github.com/0xMassi/stik_app/pull/91))
- **Clearable shortcuts:** disable individual system shortcuts. The Settings shortcut stays available so you can restore controls even with the Dock and tray icons hidden. ([#95](https://github.com/0xMassi/stik_app/pull/95))

### Changed

- **Search does less repeated work:** full-text search uses the in-memory index, reuses normalized text for result snippets, and discards stale asynchronous results. A recorded local benchmark on an Apple M4 Max reduced median common-query time from **23.58 ms to 3.83 ms** on a synthetic 10,000-note vault. These are warmed Rust index timings, not end-to-end app latency or a speedup guarantee. [Workload, measurements, and reproduction commands](docs/audits/2026-09-05-search-performance.md).
- **Capture gets startup priority:** indexing, embeddings, update checks, and background services start after capture-critical setup. Window-specific interfaces and editor language support load when needed.
- **Zen mode remembers your preference** across launches and no longer shows the empty-editor hint. ([#95](https://github.com/0xMassi/stik_app/pull/95))
- Dialog focus, keyboard navigation, status announcements, editor VoiceOver feedback, and reduced-motion behavior have been improved.
- Support links now use [massimianivalerio1@gmail.com](mailto:massimianivalerio1@gmail.com).

### Fixed

- **Rendered table edits now save:** typing or pasting into a table cell updates the underlying Markdown and participates in autosave/quit. Edits before a table or in an earlier table keep later write positions correct; literal pipes, backslashes and pasted line breaks survive reopening without overwriting adjacent cells. Select All stays within the cell being edited instead of selecting the entire note.
- Full-editor search, note actions, folder controls, Markdown widget labels and edit announcements now follow the selected language. Switching languages preserves note text, folder paths, folded sections, table focus and one-time image-loading consent.
- **Search after note changes:** a query entered before a draft finishes saving now refreshes when the save succeeds, without requiring retyping or replacing the live editor document. Renaming, archiving, or deleting a result also refreshes the active query.
- In the full editor, creating a note with no folders now opens the folder-name field instead of silently doing nothing. The empty state explains the prerequisite; cancelled setup does not recreate default folders. ([#109](https://github.com/0xMassi/stik_app/issues/109))
- **Drafts during navigation and quit:** pending edits are saved before switching notes, file actions, or closing the full editor. Orderly application quit coordinates saves across capture, pinned, viewing, and full-editor windows; failed or unacknowledged saves cancel quit and leave drafts available for retry.
- **Stale documents after reselecting a note:** explicitly reopening the same note now loads its latest saved revision into the editor. Folder/note lists and active search also refresh after native focus and external-file events without replacing a live draft.
- **Unpinning into an occupied capture:** the original capture draft is saved before the incoming note is accepted. If that save or transfer fails, the source pin remains. Pin/unpin handoffs also preserve late input, prevent overlapping dictation, and retain retry state.
- **Drafts lost after settings changes:** changing Vim mode or text direction no longer resets the editor to its original content.
- **Blank editor after initialization errors:** failed settings or asset-directory reads now show an error while keeping note source editable. This addresses those failure paths, not every possible blank-window cause.
- **Distinct viewing windows:** paths containing spaces, periods, Unicode, or URL delimiters no longer collapse to the same viewing-window identity.
- **Safer file operations:** temporarily clearing an existing note no longer deletes it. Concurrent saves use distinct temporary files, and create/rename/move conflicts do not silently overwrite another note. Folder renames update descendant settings and search paths; deleted notes stay out of search when filesystem events arrive.
- **Fonts:** built-in web fonts and imported fonts are no longer blocked by the application's content policy or an invalid asset path. Imported font reads stay confined to Stix's font directory. ([#89](https://github.com/0xMassi/stik_app/pull/89))
- **Keyboard and appearance:** physical-key shortcut matching works with non-US layouts, the editor retains its Cmd+K action, and selected Settings tabs use the active theme's accent tint. Shortcut-label localization remains separate from physical-key matching. ([#98](https://github.com/0xMassi/stik_app/pull/98))
- Native-command failures now surface actionable messages, and a nonempty Trash no longer displays an empty-state message.

### Security and privacy

- Analytics creates no identifier or event before consent; opting out removes the identifier.
- Locked-note encryption keys move from the legacy file to macOS Keychain only after verified readback. Editing a locked viewing note preserves encrypted storage; pinning requires explicitly unlocking it first.
- Note and Markdown-asset operations reject path traversal and symlink escapes outside the configured vault.
- Remote Markdown images require explicit permission before making network requests.
- Updated vulnerable dependency paths, including the Tauri origin-confusion fix and the `postcss-selector-parser` update integrated from [#100](https://github.com/0xMassi/stik_app/pull/100). This is not a claim that every upstream advisory has been eliminated.

### Developer experience

- **Bun 1.4.1** is the sole JavaScript package manager, pinned locally and in CI. Node and Vitest remain the existing tooling runtime and test runner; there is one Bun lockfile.
- `./scripts/build-dev.sh setup`, `doctor`, and `qa` provide a documented setup and native test workflow. The QA launcher builds the correct DarwinKit sidecar and uses disposable data; a Dev bundle refuses to launch without an isolated profile.
- `./scripts/verify.sh` runs frontend, Rust, and Swift tests plus build, platform, bundle-budget, formatting, and strict Clippy checks. CI also runs dependency-security audits and builds/inspects a native Intel app and sidecar. Duplicate Rust library/binary test execution and unused dependencies were removed.
- Coordinated native and JavaScript dependency updates keep Tauri plugins build-compatible. Fixed-format regression tests protect existing encrypted notes and compressed Apple Notes imports across crypto, protobuf, and compression upgrades. Intel CI now exercises the release action without signing or publishing.
- Updated Markdown parsing, Base64 encoding, directory lookup, and bundled SQLite dependencies. Compatibility tests cover clipboard Markdown extensions and read-only Apple Notes listing/import across four synthetic schema variants. Removed an unused direct Core Graphics dependency; no SIMD or SQLite speedup is claimed from these version updates alone.
- Beta tags point to the tested revision. Stable tags build a draft; Homebrew and landing-page updates wait for stable publication and reject incomplete assets, invalid checksums, or failed webhooks. The beta channel does not update the stable feed.
- Added a [release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md) for data recovery, OS integrations, privacy, accessibility, both architectures, signing, notarization, installation, and updater verification. Automated checks do not replace these acceptance steps.

### Known limitations

- Shortcut bindings use physical key positions, but some displayed shortcut labels still assume QWERTY. Layout-aware labels and live AZERTY/layout-switch verification remain tracked in [#96](https://github.com/0xMassi/stik_app/issues/96).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-13
Voice dictation, clipboard capture, and dev tooling

### Added
- **On-device voice dictation** — new `⌘⇧D` shortcut toggles live Whisper-backed dictation inside the note editor. All transcription runs locally via [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) on the Neural Engine; audio never leaves your Mac. Models are downloaded on demand and persist across launches
- **Voice note shortcut** — `⌘⇧V` opens a fresh post-it and starts dictating immediately, for frictionless capture-by-voice
- **Dictation setup modal** — first-run picker for language (auto-detect + 20 common languages) and Whisper model tier (`small` ~250 MB for speed, `large-v3 turbo` ~632 MB for accuracy). Choice is persisted, reopens on demand from Settings
- **Dictation settings panel** — new "Dictation" tab under Settings lets you change active model, switch languages, delete downloaded models, and see disk usage
- **Clip capture** — new `⌘⇧C` shortcut grabs the currently-selected text from any app (Safari, Terminal, VS Code, anywhere with a standard text field) via the Accessibility API and appends it to a dedicated "Clips" note. No clipboard round-trip, no flaky keystroke simulation
- **Accessibility permission prompts** — when clip capture is used without Accessibility granted, Stix now opens System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility directly, with session-level dedup so it doesn't re-open on every failed capture

### Fixed
- **iCloud container path broken after macOS iCloud migration** (#60) — Stix now syncs into `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Stix/` (standard iCloud Drive) instead of the legacy `iCloud~com~0xmassi~stix` container path, which had stopped working for new installs
- **Search results couldn't open notes** (#61) — `get_note_content` was rejecting valid paths because it compared raw input against a canonicalized notes root. Both sides now canonicalize before the `starts_with` check, so notes opened from semantic search results load correctly

### Changed
- **DarwinKit sidecar updated to v0.3.0** — adds `dictation.*` method surface and concurrent JSON-RPC request dispatch so slow handlers (e.g. a 30–60 s WhisperKit CoreML compilation) no longer block fast NLP calls
- **Hardened runtime gains `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`** — required for mic access under signed + notarized builds
- **App moved devtools console behind an explicit opt-in** — no longer auto-opens in debug builds, which was noisy while iterating on features that steal focus

### Developer experience
- Local dev now uses a stable code-signing identity (auto-detects `Developer ID Application` in login keychain, or falls back to a self-signed `Stix Local Dev` cert), so TCC grants (Mic, Accessibility) persist across rebuilds instead of needing to be re-granted on every `cargo build`
- Fast incremental rebuild loop (`~20–40 s` vs. `2–3 min` for full bundle) for iterating on TCC/entitlements/signing-dependent features that `tauri dev` can't cover

## [0.7.9] - 2026-03-17
Local file watching and external change detection

### Added
- **Local file watcher** — external changes to `.md` files (from CLI tools, Obsidian, scripts, etc.) are now detected in real-time and reflected in the UI without restarting. Uses `notify-rs` with FSEvents backend and 500ms debouncing
- **Auto-refresh on external changes** — CommandPalette note list, folder stats, and search results now refresh automatically when files change externally, for both local and iCloud modes

### Fixed
- **iCloud sync not refreshing note list** — `SyncIndicator` showed the sync animation but `CommandPalette` never refreshed. Now listens for `icloud-files-changed` events and updates the list

### Dependencies
- Bumped `quinn-proto` 0.11.13 → 0.11.14
- Bumped `undici` 7.21.0 → 7.24.1

## [0.7.8] - 2026-03-11
Hotfix: DarwinKit sidecar not found in production bundle

### Fixed
- **DarwinKit "bridge not started"** — sidecar path resolution looked in `Contents/Resources/binaries/` but Tauri `externalBin` places sidecars in `Contents/MacOS/`. Fixed to check the correct location. Also fixes AI features, semantic search, and folder suggestions being unavailable in release builds
- **CI: wrong DarwinKit binary** — `find` command picked up an arm64-only intermediate build artifact instead of the universal binary. Now uses the deterministic path `.build/apple/Products/Release/darwinkit`

## [0.7.7] - 2026-03-10
Hotfix: remove restricted iCloud entitlements that prevented app launch

### Fixed
- **App fails to open after update** — removed `com.apple.developer.icloud-container-identifiers` and related entitlements from `Entitlements.plist`. These restricted entitlements require a provisioning profile and caused Gatekeeper to block the app. iCloud sync still works via the well-known `~/Library/Mobile Documents/` path

## [0.7.6] - 2026-03-10
Note locking, iCloud sync, and storage abstraction

### Added
- **Note locking** — encrypt notes with AES-256-GCM, protected by Touch ID or device password. Lock/unlock via `⌘L` in command palette. Configurable session timeout (5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, or until quit) and lock-on-sleep option
- **Lock prompt modal** — Touch ID authentication UI with idle/authenticating/failed states when opening locked notes
- **Lock indicators** — lock icon and filename-derived title shown for encrypted notes in command palette and note list
- **Recovery key export** — export the encryption key as base64 from Settings > Privacy for backup purposes
- **iCloud sync** — enable in Settings to store notes in iCloud Drive, synced across all devices via `NSFileCoordinator`-based coordinated file operations
- **Note migration** — one-click migration of existing local notes to iCloud when first enabling sync
- **Sync indicator** — cloud icon in the UI pulses when iCloud sync activity is detected
- **Storage abstraction layer** — all file I/O routed through `StorageMode` (local, iCloud, or custom directory), transparent to the rest of the codebase
- **DarwinKit Auth handler** — biometric / device-password authentication via `LAContext` over JSON-RPC
- **DarwinKit Cloud handler** — 11 coordinated iCloud file operations (read, write, delete, move, copy, list, monitor) with async notification support

### Fixed
- **Window opening off-screen** — `⌘⇧S` no longer opens on a disconnected external monitor; falls back to centering on the primary display
- **Keychain double-prompting** — switched from macOS Keychain to file-based key storage (`~/.stix/note-key`) with one-time Keychain migration to avoid duplicate auth dialogs
- **Locked notes showing "Untitled"** — encrypted notes now derive a readable title from their filename slug instead of showing "Untitled"

## [0.7.5] - 2026-03-04
Editor live preview polish

### Fixed
- **Fenced code block cursor jump** — pressing Enter after typing the closing `` ``` `` fence no longer jumps the cursor back to a previous position. Root cause: CodeMirror 6 silently breaks `ViewPlugin` replace-decorations that cross newline boundaries; fence lines are now collapsed via within-line replace + CSS `height: 0` (SilverBullet pattern)
- **Heading format dropdown clipped** — the H1/H2/H3 dropdown in the formatting toolbar was cut off by `overflow: hidden`; fixed with `overflow-x: clip` which allows the dropdown to escape the container without affecting vertical scroll
- **Fenced code block flash on typing** — typing `` ` `` or `~` at the start of a line no longer causes a one-frame flash where the characters disappear. The incremental parser briefly creates an `InlineCode`/`Strikethrough` node before recognising `FencedCode`; added a guard to skip hiding markers that look like fence delimiters mid-typing
- **Smart Enter/Backspace inside fenced code** — Enter before `~~` and Backspace inside `~~~~` no longer interfere with tilde-fenced code blocks

## [0.7.4] - 2026-03-02
Window position and cursor persistence

### Added
- **Window position persistence** — capture, sticked, and viewing windows now remember their last position across sessions. All three window types share the same position, so Cmd+Shift+S and Cmd+Shift+L always open at the same spot
- **Multi-monitor support** — saved window positions are validated against connected monitors; if the target monitor is unplugged, the window falls back to centering on the primary display
- **Cursor position persistence** — cursor position is saved per-note when closing any window and restored when reopening the same note via Cmd+Shift+L

### Fixed
- **Retina display positioning** — fixed physical/logical coordinate mismatch where `outerPosition()` returned physical pixels but `WebviewWindowBuilder::position()` interpreted them as logical, causing windows to drift off-screen on HiDPI displays
- **Sticked note position drift** — sticked notes now use `set_position(PhysicalPosition)` after build (matching the official tauri-plugin-window-state approach) instead of the builder's `position()` method

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-01
Finder integration, auto-updater improvements, and cleanup

### Added
- **macOS Finder "Open With" support** — Stix now registers as a markdown editor; double-click or right-click any `.md`/`.markdown` file in Finder to open it directly in Stix (contributed by [@ildunari](https://github.com/ildunari))

### Changed
- **Smarter auto-updater** — update check now uses a 15s timeout, deduplicates already-installed updates, and avoids re-downloading the same version on repeated launches

### Fixed
- **Non-blocking file reads** — files opened via Finder are read asynchronously (`spawn_blocking`) to avoid blocking the event loop

### Removed
- **Product Hunt launch notice** — removed the one-time popup now that the launch window has passed

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-23
Product Hunt launch support

### Added
- **Product Hunt launch notice** — one-time popup on first open after launch (Feb 24, 2026 00:01 PST) linking to the Product Hunt page for upvotes and feedback. Dismisses permanently on click

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-23
Appearance settings and zen mode polish

### Added
- **Font picker** — choose from 9 curated Google Fonts (3 sans-serif, 3 serif, 3 monospace) loaded lazily on first use; or import any local font (TTF/OTF/WOFF/WOFF2) from disk via file dialog. Persisted per-settings, applies instantly to all editor windows
- **Window opacity** — background translucency slider (20–100%) in Settings > Appearance. Text stays crisp while the window fades, letting always-on-top notes reveal content underneath
- **Highlight color token** — `==text==` highlight now uses a visible amber default instead of the previous near-invisible coral. Custom themes gain a "Highlight" color picker to override per-theme

### Fixed
- **Zen mode window dragging** — restored native window dragging for all window types (capture, sticked) in zen mode (#41)
- **Zen mode button hit zones** — buttons in zen mode no longer intercept drag events, so dragging the window works anywhere on the header bar

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-19
Custom theming, settings UX hardening, and startup crash resilience

### Added
- **Appearance system** — built-in themes, custom theme creation/editing, and import/export (JSON/TOML)
- **Contributor credit** — Appearance/theming system implemented by [@plyght](https://github.com/plyght)
- **Theme runtime tokens** — centralized theme resolution and DOM token application for editor/surface colors

### Changed
- **Settings layout sizing** — wider settings window/modal with improved tab visibility for the expanded menu bar
- **Settings scrolling UI** — hidden native scrollbar in settings content to align with existing design language

### Fixed
- **Autosave race in Settings** — settings saves are now coalesced/serialized to avoid overlapping writes and stale persistence
- **Theme migration behavior** — safer fallback from `active_theme` to legacy `theme_mode` when loading older/mismatched settings
- **Theme import validation** — strict color parsing rejects malformed color inputs
- **Crash hardening** — UTF-8 boundary-safe slicing and panic-source cleanup in startup/runtime hot paths to prevent SIGABRT in release

## [0.6.6] - 2026-02-18
Security patch

### Fixed
- **Security: glib vulnerability** — bumped `glib` transitive dependency to `>=0.20.0` to address [GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g) / RUSTSEC-2024-0429. Unsound `Iterator` and `DoubleEndedIterator` implementations in `VariantStrIter` (medium severity)

## [0.6.5] - 2026-02-18
Inline images, RTL support, zen mode, and quality-of-life improvements (#37)

### Added
- **Inline image rendering** — pasted/dropped images render as live previews inside the editor. Click to reveal raw markdown for editing, move cursor away to re-render. Broken images show a placeholder
- **RTL and bidirectional text support** — three modes (Auto/LTR/RTL) in Settings > Editor. Auto mode detects direction per line using the browser's Unicode Bidi Algorithm, ideal for Arabic, Hebrew, and mixed-language notes
- **Zen mode** — press Cmd+. (customizable in Settings > Shortcuts) to toggle distraction-free writing. Hides header, footer, and formatting toolbar
- **Hide menu bar icon** — toggle in Settings > Editor to remove the tray icon from the menu bar. Stix remains accessible via global shortcuts
- **Capture window size persistence** — the quick capture window remembers its size across sessions. Resize once, and it stays

### Fixed
- **Image save bug** — notes containing images now save correctly. Reads editor content directly from CodeMirror's document at save time instead of relying on async state

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-17
Heading fold/collapse

### Added
- **Heading fold/collapse** — hover any heading (H1–H3) to reveal a chevron; click to collapse everything below until the next same-or-higher-level heading. Folded chevron stays visible in coral. Placing cursor in folded area auto-expands. Restores feature lost during TipTap→CM6 migration (#36)

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-16
Discord link refresh, auto-updater toggle, and YouTube demo

### Added
- **Auto-updater toggle** — disable background update checks from Settings > Privacy (enabled by default)
- **YouTube demo link** — added to README header navigation

### Changed
- **Discord invite link** — updated across README, CONTRIBUTING, and in-app settings

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-16
Vim command-mode reliability and markdown link UX fixes

### Added
- **Cmd-hover link affordance** — while holding Cmd, external markdown/bare links now show a pointer cursor before click
- **Targeted regression tests** — added coverage for link insertion selection, link marker hiding, Vim command callback routing, `:` command-bar trigger logic, and visual-arrow handling

### Fixed
- **`Cmd+K` URL selection placement** — link insertion now selects only `url`, so replacing destination works in one pass
- **Markdown link preview rendering** — when cursor is outside a link, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, and URL are hidden, leaving clean linked text
- **Vim `:wq` / `:x` execution path** — ex commands now invoke save-and-close handlers instead of incorrectly toggling command mode
- **Vim `:` command bar trigger** — pressing `:` in normal/visual mode reliably opens the custom command bar
- **Vim visual highlight visibility** — enabled CM6 `drawSelection()` so visual selections remain visible despite Vim's transparent native selection styling
- **Arrow-key behavior in visual mode** — arrow keys are explicitly routed through Vim while visual mode is active, preventing accidental visual-mode exit

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-15
Capture window stability and auto-updater fix

### Fixed
- **Ghost process from auto-updater in dev mode** — `downloadAndInstall()` was extracting to a temp dir and spawning a second Stix process from an older release, causing two instances to compete for the global shortcut. Auto-updater now skips in dev builds
- **Stale content on fast Escape** — `handleSaveAndClose` reads from a ref instead of React state closure, preventing "/" or empty content from being saved when typing + Escape outraces React's render flush
- **Folder picker stuck open after blur-auto-hide** — hiding the window via blur (switching to another app) bypassed `handleSaveAndClose`, leaving `showPicker=true` on reopen. Picker now resets on window focus
- **Escape ignored with folder picker open** — pressing Escape when the folder picker was visible was a no-op; now explicitly dismisses the picker (next Escape saves/closes)
- **CM6 autocomplete not reopening after clear** — after a hide/show cycle, CodeMirror's "explicitly closed" state prevented `activateOnTyping` from showing slash commands. Now forces `startCompletion` when a slash prefix is detected
- **Blur-auto-hide false triggers** — debounced with 140ms delay + grace period to prevent OS focus event races from hiding the window during shortcut-triggered reopen

### Changed
- **Drop cursor styling** — separated from main cursor; uses subtle 35% opacity instead of solid coral

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-14
Unified Command Palette, CodeMirror editor, interactive tables, and Apple Notes import

### Added
- **Unified Command Palette** — merged Search (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and Manager (`Cmd+Shift+M`) into a single two-pane window with folder sidebar + note list. Both shortcuts open the same palette
- **Sidebar position toggle** — switch Command Palette sidebar between left and right, persisted in settings
- **Inline note creation** — create notes directly from the Command Palette via the "New Note" footer button
- **CodeMirror 6 editor** — replaced Tiptap with CodeMirror for source-mode markdown editing with syntax highlighting, better performance, and extensibility
- **Interactive table widgets** — markdown tables render as editable rich widgets with Tab/Shift+Tab cell navigation, right-click context menu (insert/delete rows and columns), and keyboard exits (Escape, Enter from last row)
- **Horizontal rule widgets** — `---` renders as a styled divider line in the editor
- **Slash commands** — type `/` at line start for Notion/Raycast-style template insertion (headings, lists, code blocks, tables, templates)
- **Custom user templates** — define reusable slash command templates in Settings with `{{cursor}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{day}}` placeholders
- **Read-only Apple Notes import** — browse and import notes from Apple Notes via SQLite + protobuf parsing (#29)
- **Note template library** — built-in `/meeting`, `/standup`, `/journal`, `/brainstorm`, `/retro`, `/proscons`, `/weekly` templates with dynamic date insertion

### Changed
- **Editor engine** — migrated from Tiptap (ProseMirror) to CodeMirror 6 for native markdown source editing
- **Window consolidation** — `search` and `manager` windows replaced by single `command-palette` window
- **PostIt footer** — two separate search/manager buttons consolidated into single Command Palette button

### Fixed
- **Table cursor trap** — block-level table widgets at document end no longer trap the cursor; trailing newline auto-inserted
- **Tauri capability permissions** — `command-palette` window added to capability allow-list, fixing `event.emit` errors
- **Settings race condition** — centralized `saveAndEmitSettings` helper prevents concurrent settings mutations from overwriting each other

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-11
Editor toolbar, font zoom, and quality-of-life fixes

### Added
- **Formatting toolbar** — bottom bar with quick-access buttons for heading (H1/H2/H3 dropdown), bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code, link, blockquote, bullet list, ordered list, task list, and highlight. Active state follows cursor position in real-time
- **Link button integration** — toolbar link button dispatches `Cmd+K` to open the existing LinkPopover editor, no separate prompt
- **Toolbar toggle** — show/hide formatting bar via footer button (T icon), persisted in localStorage. Auto-hidden in vim mode
- **Configurable font size** — `Cmd+`/`Cmd-` to zoom editor text (range 12-48px), `Cmd+0` to reset. Stepper in Settings > Editor. Headings and code scale proportionally
- **Root-level notes** — save notes directly to `~/Documents/Stix/` without requiring a folder. Shows "Stix" badge when no folder is set
- **Footer quick-access buttons** — search, manager, and settings buttons in the PostIt footer for all window types
- **Community standards** — added CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, issue templates, and PR template

### Fixed
- **Image assets cleaned up on delete/move** — deleting a note removes its `.assets/` images; moving a note relocates them to the target folder
- **Editor content preserved on folder switch** — folder picker no longer clears typed content when switching folders
- **Stale index after folder delete** — NoteIndex and EmbeddingIndex entries are purged when a folder is deleted, preventing ghost notes in search
- **Highlight 1-char bug** — highlight button now requires a text selection (mark's `inclusive:false` caused stored marks to last only 1 character)
- **Image export hides chrome** — "Copy as image" now hides buttons, toolbar, and action bar, showing only the styled note content
- **Image export rounded corners** — screenshot clips to the PostIt's 14px border-radius instead of rectangular webview bounds
- **Toolbar horizontal scroll** — formatting bar scrolls horizontally on narrow windows with hidden scrollbar

### Changed
- **Settings-changed event on folder delete** — capture window re-resolves default folder after deletion

## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-10
Features, privacy, and search improvements

### Added
- **Hide dock icon** — tray-only mode via Settings > Editor
- **Folder colors** — assign colors to folders, reflected in search badges and folder picker
- **Customizable system shortcuts** — rebind Cmd+Shift+P/M/L/, in Settings > Shortcuts
- **Anonymous analytics** — privacy-respecting usage telemetry via PostHog (EU endpoint, opt-out in Settings > Privacy)
- **Analytics notice popup** — one-time "What's New" notice for existing users with opt-out path and community links
- **Privacy settings tab** — toggle analytics, view what's collected, copy anonymous device ID
- **Folder-scoped search** — filter search results by folder via popover in the search header (#23)

### Fixed
- **Viewing window left open after note deletion** — close viewing window when its note is deleted from another window (#19)
- **Disabled folder shortcuts persisting** — normalization now force-enables all visible shortcuts

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-09
Stability fixes for link editing and settings

### Fixed
- **Escape behavior while editing links** — pressing `Esc` in the link edit popover now closes only the popover and returns focus to the note, without closing/saving the whole capture window
- **Settings side-effect folder recreation** — opening Settings no longer recreates deleted folders (including `Inbox`) during Git status checks

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-09
Community and support links

### Added
- **Settings footer social links** — new Help/X/Discord quick actions next to the app version in both settings surfaces (modal and standalone settings window)
- **Help action in app settings** — one-click support contact via `mailto:massimianivalerio1@gmail.com`

### Changed
- **Support channels updated** — README now points to `massimianivalerio1@gmail.com` plus official X and Discord community links

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-09
Editing and reliability polish

### Added
- **Link shortcuts for selected text** — press `Cmd+K` or `Cmd+L` to open link editing for the current selection
- **Cleaner note previews** — search/manager now derive readable titles/snippets from markdown content
- **Desktop image drop support** — drag images from Finder/Desktop into notes with local-path import into `.assets/`

### Fixed
- **Link navigation control** — plain click no longer navigates externally; use `Cmd+Click` or popover Open action
- **Reopen last note (`Cmd+Shift+L`)** — now tracks notes opened from Search and Manager, not only newly saved notes
- **Image reopen rendering** — dropped/pasted images persist with normalized paths and render correctly after reopening notes
- **Folder edge-case behavior** — capture/save flow now works when default/requested folders are missing or folder sets are empty

### Changed
- **Folder selection logic** centralized via shared fallback resolution for capture and save operations
- **Image path normalization** now supports `asset://localhost`, `asset.localhost`, and `file://` forms
- **Link interaction model** aligns editor behavior with popover controls and explicit shortcut-based navigation

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-08
Editor power-ups & quality of life

### Added
- **Vim mode** — full modal editing with Normal, Insert, Visual, and Command modes. Toggle in Settings > Editor. Includes status bar indicator, text objects (`ciw`, `ci"`, `di(`), and `:wq`/`:q!` commands
- **Highlighting** (`==text==`) — wrap text in `==` for visual emphasis. Renders with coral background, roundtrips to markdown, adapts to light/dark theme
- **Collapsible headings** — hover any heading to reveal a fold chevron. Click to collapse/expand content beneath. Purely visual, no markdown markers
- **Wiki-links** (`[[slug]]`) — type `[[` to autocomplete and link to other notes. Renders as styled inline element, click to open the referenced note. Stored as literal `[[slug]]` in markdown
- **Link popover** — place cursor inside any link to see a floating toolbar with Open, Copy, Edit, and Unlink actions
- **Markdown link input rule** — type `[text](url)` to instantly create a clickable link with URL normalization and protocol safety
- **Image paste & drop** — paste or drag images into the editor. Saved to `.assets/` alongside the note, referenced as standard markdown images
- **Task list input fix** — typing `- [ ] ` now correctly creates a checkbox (fixes BulletList/TaskItem conflict)
- **Custom notes directory** — choose any folder as your notes root via Settings > Folders
- **Reopen last note** (`Cmd+Shift+L`) — instantly reopen the most recently saved note
- **Theme customization** — System, Light, and Dark modes with live switching
- **Automated test suite** — 38 unit tests covering URL normalization, XSS escaping, slug generation, and markdown roundtrips

### Fixed
- **Link click behavior** — Cmd+Click opens external links, regular click positions cursor (no accidental navigation)
- **Dangerous URL protocols** — `javascript:`, `data:`, and `file:` URLs are rejected and sanitized
- **XSS in wiki-link slugs** — HTML entities escaped in rendered wiki-link nodes
- **Sticky highlight formatting** — `inclusive: false` prevents highlight from bleeding into adjacent text

### Changed
- **Editor extensions** refactored into individual files under `src/extensions/`
- **CI/CD pipeline** — secrets scoped to specific workflow steps, Vercel deploy hook secured

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-07
Silent auto-updates

### Added
- **Auto-updater** — silently downloads updates in the background, applies on next app restart
- **Version display** — app version shown in the settings footer

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-07
Polish & bug fixes

### Fixed
- **Double tray icon** — removed duplicate tray icon created by both config and code (#2)
- **Menu bar icon appearance** — use a proper macOS template icon that adapts to light/dark mode (#3)
- **Ctrl registered as Cmd in shortcuts** — Ctrl (⌃) and Cmd (⌘) are now correctly distinguished when recording and registering shortcuts (#4)
- **Links not clickable** — Cmd+Click on links in the editor now opens them in the default browser; cursor changes to pointer when Cmd is held over a link (#5)

### Changed
- Homebrew install instructions updated to use `0xMassi/stik` tap

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-06

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-06
On-device AI & git sharing

### Added
- **On-device AI features** powered by DarwinKit sidecar (Apple NaturalLanguage framework, zero cloud dependency)
  - **Semantic search** — hybrid text + semantic results in search modal with similarity badges
  - **Folder suggestions** — real-time AI-powered folder pill while capturing notes, based on folder centroids
  - **Note embeddings** — background embedding build on launch, persisted to `~/.stix/embeddings.json`
- **Git sharing** — sync folders via git with configurable repository layout (monorepo or per-folder), background auto-sync worker
- **Capture streak** — consecutive-day counter shown in tray menu and settings
- **On This Day** — daily notification resurfacing notes from the same date in prior years
- **Share as clipboard** — copy notes as rich text, plain markdown, or image snapshot to clipboard
- **AI settings tab** — dedicated settings section to enable/disable AI features with privacy documentation
- **Raycast-style settings redesign** — horizontal tab bar with SVG icons, scrollable content, resizable window (620x700)

### Fixed
- **Language-aware embeddings** — Apple NLEmbedding uses different vector dimensions per language (e.g. English=512, Italian=640); similarity and centroid calculations now filter by matching language
- **Folder suggestion threshold** — lowered from 0.5 to 0.35 for better suggestions with small note collections
- **Settings overflow** — content was clipped by `overflow: hidden` on root elements; now properly scrollable

### Changed
- **Settings window** enlarged from 500x600 to 620x700, now resizable with min size 520x500
- **Tab state** moved from `SettingsContent` to `SettingsModal` — content component is now a pure renderer
- **Insights layout** changed from 2-column grid to vertical stack for better scrolling

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-06
Security hardening & architecture refactor

### Added
- **In-memory note index** for fast search and listing (two-tier: preview match then full-file fallback)
- **On-demand content loading** — search/list results no longer carry full file content over IPC
- **Versioned JSON storage** — settings and sticked notes use `{ version, data }` envelope with auto-migration
- **Path traversal validation** on folder/note names
- **Content Security Policy** — restrictive CSP for the webview
- **Scoped filesystem permissions** — limited to `~/Documents/Stix/` and `~/.stix/`
- **Toast notification** when attempting to delete the protected Inbox folder
- **Shared TypeScript types** (`src/types/index.ts`) used across all components
- **Extracted `SettingsContent` component** — shared settings UI for both window and dialog modes

### Fixed
- **Capture window no longer hides on blur when content is present** — only auto-hides when editor is empty
- **Pinned note content loss on quit** — debounced content autosave for sticked notes
- **Filename collisions** — UUID suffix prevents same-second overwrites
- **Pinned note position reset** — window position persisted after centering
- **Viewing note cache leak** — entries cleaned up on window close
- **Mutex crashes** — all `.lock().unwrap()` replaced with poisoned-mutex recovery
- **Sticked notes JSON corruption** — atomic writes via temp file + rename
- **Search highlight bug** — fixed stateful global regex with index parity
- **Stale folder selection** — selection resets after folder deletion in manager
- **Viewing window stuck on "Loading..."** — error state with close button

### Changed
- **Split `main.rs`** from 991 lines into 5 focused modules: `state.rs`, `shortcuts.rs`, `windows.rs`, `tray.rs`, and slim orchestrator `main.rs` (~120 lines)
- **`SettingsModal`** reduced from ~465 to ~135 lines via shared `SettingsContent`

### Removed
- `tauri-plugin-store` dependency (unused)
- Unused settings commands (`get_shortcut_mappings`, `save_shortcut_mapping`, `set_setting`)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-05
First release

### Added
- **Core capture flow**: Global shortcut summons post-it, type, close to save
- **Folder organization**: Inbox, Work, Ideas, Personal, Projects (customizable)
- **Global shortcuts**:
  - `Cmd+Shift+S` - New note in default folder
  - `Cmd+Shift+F` - Select folder then capture
  - `Cmd+Shift+P` - Search all notes
  - `Cmd+Shift+M` - Manage notes & folders
  - `Cmd+Shift+,` - Open settings
- **Search modal**: Find notes instantly with highlighted matches
- **Manager modal**: Browse folders, expand to see notes, delete/rename
- **Folder selector**: Quick folder switching with create-on-the-fly
- **Pin notes**: Keep important notes floating on desktop
- **Settings**: Configure shortcuts, default folder, folder-specific hotkeys
- **File management**:
  - Delete notes (`Backspace` in search/manager)
  - Move notes between folders (`Cmd+M` in search)
  - Delete folders (`Backspace` in folder selector)
  - Rename folders (`Cmd+R` in folder selector)
- **Safety**: Inbox folder protected from deletion/rename
- **Rich text editor**: Markdown support via Tiptap
- **Local storage**: Notes saved as `.md` files in `~/Documents/Stix/`

### Technical
- Built with Tauri 2.0 (Rust backend, React frontend)
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Tiptap for rich text editing
