# Stix Full Hardening Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Resolve the actionable security, privacy, data-integrity, performance, accessibility, maintainability, and delivery findings in the 2026-08-30 full-application audit and produce a locally runnable macOS build.

**Architecture:** Centralize filesystem authorization and recoverable storage behavior in Rust; make privacy state explicit and safe by default; keep capture eager while loading other windows and background services lazily; use reusable accessible UI primitives; enforce the resulting invariants in tests and CI.

**Tech Stack:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest/Testing Library, Tauri 2, Rust, Swift/DarwinKit, macOS Security framework, GitHub Actions.

---

## Execution rules

- Work only in `/Users/massimianiv/.config/superpowers/worktrees/stik_app/full-hardening` on `codex/full-hardening`.
- Preserve the original checkout and its uncommitted files.
- For every production behavior, write one focused failing test and observe the expected failure before implementation.
- Commit after each task with only that task's files.
- Run targeted tests during red-green cycles and the full relevant suite before each commit.
- Do not change GitHub branch protection, close issues, publish releases, or push without explicit authorization after local verification.

### Task 1: Finish WIP integration and establish a green baseline

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/components/EditorWindow.tsx`
- Modify: `src/i18n/locales/en.ts`
- Modify: every locale under `src/i18n/locales/*.ts`
- Test: `src/i18n/noUntranslatedText.test.ts`

**Steps:**
1. Use the already-failing untranslated-text test as RED and record its six EditorWindow labels.
2. Add typed translation keys and replace the literals with `t()` calls.
3. Run `npm test -- src/i18n/noUntranslatedText.test.ts` and confirm GREEN.
4. Run `npm test`, `npm run build`, and `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
5. Commit `fix(editor): integrate nested editor on develop`.

### Task 2: Eliminate asset and folder path traversal

**Files:**
- Create: `src-tauri/src/commands/path_security.rs`

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests rejecting `.assets/../../outside`, separators, absolute paths, dot components, non-generated extensions, and symlink escapes while accepting generated UUID image filenames.
2. Run the targeted Rust tests and confirm failures expose current permissive behavior.
3. Implement `validate_asset_filename`, `canonical_path_within`, `authorize_existing_managed_note`, and `authorize_target_within`.
4. Route asset move/delete and remote-branch `move_note` target resolution through the helpers.
5. Keep asset parsing conservative: invalid references are ignored, never resolved.
6. Run targeted tests, then full Cargo tests and Clippy for touched targets.
7. Commit `fix(security): contain note and asset filesystem paths`.

- Test: Rust nested-folder table tests and frontend folder tests

**Steps:**
1. Write failing tests for nested image save validation, recursive stats, distinct centroid identities, and full relative folder paths for Finder-opened notes.
2. Replace remaining single-name validation with canonical relative-folder validation.
3. Make stats recursive and define whether parent counts include descendants; expose both direct and total counts if UI needs both.
4. Compute embedding folder identity relative to the configured notes root.

2. Replace immutable startup-only enable state with an atomic/runtime configuration API.
3. Create the ID lazily only when an opted-in event is sent.
4. Add explicit Enable and No thanks actions to the first-run dialog and save consent before enabling.
5. Make the Settings privacy toggle update runtime state and provide Reset analytics identifier.

2. Add `load_remote_images` with a safe false default and an accessible privacy toggle.
3. Implement “Load once” per blocked image without persisting consent.
4. Add the selected custom notes directory recursively to `asset_protocol_scope` at startup and when settings change.

4. Write a failing TypeScript test where request 1 resolves after request 2 and is rejected as stale.
5. Gate Command Palette state commits with the latest request generation and clear searching state only for the latest request.
6. Add a deterministic large-corpus benchmark/smoke budget.

- Create: `docs/release-checklist.md`
- Test: shell syntax/static config tests where practical

**Steps:**
1. Write a config consistency test/script that fails while Tauri/Swift/Homebrew/docs disagree on macOS minimum.
2. Set macOS 14 consistently and update Homebrew syntax.
3. Correct telemetry, editor architecture, atomic-write, and current-delivery documentation.
4. Add a defensive dev script that builds the correct-arch DarwinKit sidecar, installs it under the target-triple name, and runs/builds Tauri.
5. Add the release checklist from the design.
6. Run config tests and `bash -n scripts/build-dev.sh`; commit `docs(release): align platform privacy and build instructions`.

### Task 15: Full verification and runnable application handoff

**Files:**
- Update: audit report with resolution status and any measured results

**Steps:**
1. Run `npm test` and `npm run build`.
2. Run `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all -- --check`, strict Clippy, and Cargo tests.
3. Run `swift test`.
4. Run npm and Cargo audits and the bundle budget.
5. Run the dev build script to produce a debug/release `.app` as appropriate.
6. Launch the built app, verify the process/sidecar start, and capture logs without modifying real notes; use an isolated temporary notes directory if supported.
7. Inspect `git diff --check`, status, changed-file scope, and compare every audit action item against implementation evidence.
8. Update the report resolution matrix and commit `docs(audit): record hardening verification`.
9. Use the finishing-development-branch skill to present merge/push/PR options; do not publish without user choice.
