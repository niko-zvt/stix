# Roadmap

> Current version: **0.8.0**

Stix ships when a phase is useful, not when it is complete. Items are moved to
✅ only when they are on `main` and released — not when a branch exists.

### Phase 6 — Knowledge Graph — started early

- [ ] Backlinks panel ("notes linking to this note")
- [ ] Graph view of note connections (wiki-links visualization)
- [ ] Daily digest notification (AI summary of captured thoughts)
- [ ] Smart resurfacing (context-aware, not just "On This Day")

### Phase 7 — Ecosystem

- [x] Raycast extension (`0xMassi/stik-raycast`)
- [x] Internationalization foundation + Simplified Chinese (v0.9.0-dev)
- [ ] CLI/API for scripting (`stix capture "text"`)
- [ ] PKM integration (folder aliasing to Obsidian vaults, Logseq)
- [ ] Export rules (trigger-based actions on note save)
- [ ] Alfred extension

### Phase 8 — Mobile & Sync (v1.0)

Planned in detail in [MOBILE_PLAN.md](MOBILE_PLAN.md). Desktop, iOS, Android
and cloud sync ship together as 1.0.

**One React Native app for both platforms**
- [ ] `@stix/tokens` — design tokens extracted from `src/themes`, consumed by
      desktop, the editor bundle, and NativeWind
- [ ] Expo bare project with NativeWind + react-native-reusables (the
      shadcn/ui port for React Native)
- [ ] Filename contract ported to TypeScript, tested for parity with `notes.rs`
- [ ] Capture screen, note list, folder navigation
- [ ] Existing CodeMirror `WebEditor` bundle hosted in a WebView

**Platform surfaces**
- [ ] iPhone Action button — Swift native module reusing the scaffold's
      `QuickCaptureIntent`; App Intents are Swift on any stack
- [ ] iOS iCloud Drive module; Android Storage Access Framework module
- [ ] Android share target and quick-settings tile

**Stix Cloud — the critical path, roughly 3x the app work**
- [ ] Auth and account
- [ ] E2E envelope: Argon2id, per-note keys, recovery key. Zero-knowledge, so
      no password reset exists by design
- [ ] Sync engine with version vectors and conflict copies
- [ ] €4.99/mo or €49.99/yr — Apple takes 15% under the Small Business Program.
      Infra on Hetzner is ~€17–38/mo, so break-even is ~10 subscribers; see
      [MOBILE_PLAN.md](MOBILE_PLAN.md) for the full math
- [ ] IAP on both stores, Stripe on desktop
- [ ] Behind a feature flag from day one, so an unfinished backend never
      blocks shipping app binaries

## Guiding Principles

- **Local-first** — Your notes are markdown files on your machine. No cloud required.
- **Privacy by design** — All AI features run on-device via Apple frameworks. Nothing leaves your Mac.
- **Open source** — Every line of code is auditable. MIT licensed.
- **Free forever** — The full app is free and open source. Optional paid sync for those who want it. No lock-in, ever.
- **Fast and simple** — Sub-second capture. Keyboard-driven. Stay out of the way.

## v0.9 — Hardening (release candidate)

The implementation pass is complete; the remaining gates require signed artifacts, live assistive-technology testing, or repository-administrator changes. These items are not considered shipped until 0.9 is published.

### Implemented for 0.9

- [x] Filesystem containment for note, asset, font, and locked-note paths, including symlink and traversal regression tests.
- [x] Recoverable Trash with restore, conflict protection, and permanent purge.
- [x] Nested-folder and dedicated editor-window behavior integrated end to end.
- [x] Analytics disabled until explicit consent; disabling it deletes the anonymous identifier.
- [x] Remote Markdown images blocked by default with a clear user-controlled opt-in.
- [x] Locked-note keys stored in macOS Keychain with verified migration from the legacy key file.
- [x] Full note text indexed in memory, stale async searches discarded, and large-index performance covered by a smoke budget.
- [x] Startup work deferred behind capture readiness and window-specific UI loaded lazily; the main entry is protected by a bundle budget.
- [x] Keyboard/VoiceOver dialog primitives, live announcements, visible focus, larger targets, reduced motion, and editor interaction coverage.
- [x] Vault Health diagnostics, index repair, storage access checks, and exportable support information.
- [x] Rust orchestration moved out of the executable; formatting and strict Clippy are blocking.
- [x] Frontend, Rust, and Swift tests plus npm/Cargo security audits run in CI. Dependabot covers npm, Cargo, Swift, and GitHub Actions.
- [x] macOS 14 is the single app, sidecar, CI, documentation, and Homebrew minimum.

### Release gates still requiring verification

- [ ] Complete the live keyboard-only and VoiceOver checklist on a signed macOS 14+ build.
- [ ] Exercise local, custom-directory, iCloud, Git sync, lock migration, and Trash recovery against disposable test data.
- [ ] Verify Apple Silicon and Intel signed/notarized artifacts, updater upgrade, and Homebrew install using the [release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md).
- [ ] Configure required CI checks and conversation resolution for `main` and `develop` in GitHub repository settings.
- [ ] Verify fixes in the published build before closing their GitHub issues.

### Longer-term maintainability

- [ ] Split `SettingsContent.tsx`, `PostIt.tsx`, `CommandPalette.tsx`, and `git_share.rs` around tested behavior boundaries.
- [ ] Generate a typed frontend/backend IPC contract and replace remaining silent error paths.
- [ ] Add a repeatable native window/tray smoke harness and collect shortcut-to-caret p50/p95 measurements.
- [ ] Translate backend-generated streak and “On This Day” data in the frontend.
- [ ] Review and document every AppKit `unsafe` invariant.
